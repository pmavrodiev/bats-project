bats-project

The new-approach branch is a change from chunk separation of raw data to a pair-wise approach.
Instead of building chunks of related recordings, we build a pair of all individuals who were spotted within X minutes of each other, and one was naiive, the other - experienced. That would be the way to identify leading following behaviour. The parameter to play with is X.
